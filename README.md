# 🎵 AirBeats – Wave Your Hands, Make Some Noise!

Welcome to **AirBeats** – the magical, musical playground where your fingers become instruments and your webcam is your wand. No wires, no strings attached – just *you* and your groove! 🕺💃

## 🚀 What is this?

**AirBeats** is a gesture-powered MIDI controller built for fun, learning, and performance. It uses your webcam + hand movements to play chords using virtual instruments. Piano, Guitar, Violin – you name it – all at your fingertips (literally).

## ✨ Features

## 🧠 How it works

1. Start the camera 🎬  
2. Wave your hand in front of your webcam 👋  
3. Press your fingers like you're playing an invisible air-instrument 🪄  
4. Let the music play 🎵

Each finger is mapped to a specific chord:
- 👍 Thumb: D-F#-A
- 👆 Index: E-G-B
- 🖕 Middle: F#-A-C#

- 🤙 Pinky: A-C#-E

Each hand plays a different octave to keep things layered and fun!
